#### What is it?

QuickIVA is a small plugin which adds a switch to the IVA at the loading or the launch of a vessel.

I suggest you to use the awesome mod RasterPropMonitor which makes the IVA usable.
QuickIVA support the mod Probe Control Room.

#### How does it work ?

It will put you on IVA at launch or at load. It will select preferably the first Pilot on a pod or the first Kerbal on a pod.

It will not put you on IVA, if there are:
* no Kerbals alive on the vessel,
* no IVA model.

The HUD can be automaticaly hide and the others camera / MapView can be disabled.

Keyboard shortcuts:
* "end" to recovery,
* "home" to EVA.

#### How to install it?

Unzip all files. Put the QuickIVA folder in your KSP/GameData folder.

#### How to update it?

Unzip all files. Merge the new QuickIVA folder with the old folder which is in your KSP/GameData folder.

#### How to uninstall it?

Delete the QuickIVA folder in your KSP/GameData folder.
